**Note: I chose an arbitrary number to truncate the strings when they are too large for the size of the screen, however this can be changed by adjusting the values in the JavaScript file**

**Note: Since Chrome Developer tools emulates a phone, the hover background color is only able to be viewed when the screen is rendered in the regular Chrome Developer Tools rather than the Android Screen**

**Note: Since I didn't have access to the images provided in the markup, I just set the image to be the type of data. Ie. Person, Place, Quote**

Additional Information:

I implemented the functionality that goes back to the main search bar screen once the cross is clicked on the last screen.
